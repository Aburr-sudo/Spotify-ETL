# Spotify-ETL
## Project Description
This project uses the Spotify API to automatically extract, validate and store song information data from songs that a Spotify user has 
recently listened to. Data is stored and retrieved from a Postgres database. The retrieved data 
is in monthly intervals to display to the user some basic analytics about their listening habits from month to month.
